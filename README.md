# Thailand dynamic QR code payment generate with PHP Slim Framework

Example

    https://qr.zercle.org/api/prompt-pay?maidata={PromptPayID}&amount={AmountInFullTHB}

Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Slim Framework 3 application. This application uses the latest Slim 3 with the PHP-View template renderer. It also uses the Monolog logger.

This skeleton application was built for Composer. This makes setting up a new Slim Framework application quick and easy.

## Install the Application

Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Slim Framework application.

    git clone https://github.com/zercle/thai-qr-pay.git
    cd thai-qr-pay
    composer install

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's `public/` directory.
* Ensure `logs/` is web writeable.

That's it! Now go build something cool.
